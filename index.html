    <h1>A simple script to understand private and public properties in a JavaScript object</h1>
    <p>
        Sometimes I find it confusing to understand the scope of variables in a JavaScript "object".
        In JavaScript there is no public or private keywords, the scope is defined by where and how the property is
        defined.
    </p>

    <p>
        So I wrote this small script as an example for myself when programming JavaScript objects and having private and
        public properties. Have a look at it here <a href="fg.object.js">fg.object.js</a>.
    </p>

    <p>Below is the output of the script while testing functions and properties.</p>

<script type="text/javascript" src="fg.object.js"></script>
